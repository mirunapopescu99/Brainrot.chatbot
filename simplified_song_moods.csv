"Vampire","Olivia Rodrigo","I used to think I was smart, but you made me look so naive. The way you sold me for parts as you sunk your teeth into me. Oh, bloodsucker, fame fucker, bleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire. And every girl I ever talked to told me you were bad, bad news. You called them crazy; God, I hate the way I called them crazy too. You're so convincing. How do you lie without flinching? Ooh, what a mesmerizing, paralyzing, fucked-up little thrill.

You know that I bought it (oh yeah, you're right, I want it). Killing me slow, out the window. I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below. Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes. What doesn't kill me makes me want you more. And it's new, the shape of your body. It's blue, the feeling I've got. And it's ooh, whoa-oh. It's a cruel summer.

"Kill Bill","SZA","I'm so mature, I'm so mature, I'm so mature. I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men. I don't want none; I just want you. If I can't have you, no one should. I might; I might kill my ex, not the best idea. His new girlfriend's next; how'd I get here? I might kill my ex; I still love him though. Rather be in jail than alone. I get the sense that it's a lost cause; I get the sense that you might really love her. This text gon' be evidence; this text is evidence. I tried to ration with you; no murders or crimes of passion, but damn. You was out of reach; you was at the farmer's market with your perfect peach. Now I'm in the basement planning home invasion.

"Anti-Hero","Taylor Swift","I should not be left to my own devices. They come with prices and vices. I end up in crisis (tale as old as time). I wake up screaming from dreaming. One day I'll watch as you're leaving 'cause you got tired of my scheming (for the last time). It's me hi, I'm the problem, it's me. At tea time everybody agrees. I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror. It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero. Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby and I'm a monster on the hill. Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city. Pierced through the heart but never killed.","introspective","Midnights"

My church offers no absolutes; she tells me, 'Worship in the bedroom.' The only heaven I'll be sent to is when I'm alone with you. I was born sick but I love it; command me to be well. Amen, amen, amen. Take me to church; I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies. I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife. Offer me that deathless death; oh good God, let me give you my life. Take me to church; I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies. I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife.

And the piano, it sounds like a carnival, and the microphone smells like a beer. And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar and say, 'Man, what are you doin' here?'

He was no more than a baby then; well, he seemed broken-hearted. Something within him. But the moment that I first laid eyes on him, all alone on the edge of seventeen.

No tomorrow, no tomorrow, And I find it kind of funny, I find it kind of sad, The dreams in which I'm dying, Are the best I've ever had. I find it hard to tell you. I find it hard to take, When people run in circles, it's a very, very, Mad world, mad world. Children waiting for the day they feel good, Happy birthday, happy birthday, And I feel the way that every child should. Sit and listen, sit and listen. Went to school and I was very nervous. No one knew me, no one knew me. 'Hello, teacher! Tell me, what's my lesson?', Look right through me, look right through me.","mysterious","Trading Snakeoil for Wolftickets"
"House of the Rising Sun","The Animals","There is a house in New Orleans They call The Rising Sun, And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy. And God, I know I'm one, My mother was a tailor. She sewed my new blue jeans, My father was a gamblin' man. Down in New Orleans. Now the only thing a gambler needs. Is a suitcase and a trunk, And the only time he's satisfied, Is when he's on a trump, Oh mother, tell your children, Not to do what I have done, Spend your lives in sin and misery. In the house of The Rising Sun. Well, I got one foot on the platform. The other foot on the train, I'm goin' back to New Orleans, To wear that ball and chain, Well, there is a house in New Orleans, They call The Rising Sun, And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy And God, I know I'm one.","mysterious","The Animals"
"The Night We Met","Lord Huron","I am not the only traveler. Who has not repaid his debt, I've been searching for a trail to follow again, Take me back to the night we met. And then I can tell myself, What the hell I'm supposed to do, And then I can tell myself, Not to ride along with you. I had all and then most of you, Some and now none of you, Take me back to the night we met. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. Haunted by the ghost of you, Oh, take me back to the night we met, When the night was full of terrors. And your eyes were filled with tears. When you had not touched me yet, Oh, take me back to the night we met.","mysterious","Strange Trails"

So honey now, Take me into your loving arms. Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars, Place your head on my beating heart. I'm thinking out loud, Maybe we found love right where we are.","thinking","x"
"Fast Car","Tracy Chapman","You got a fast car, And I want a ticket to anywhere. Maybe we make a deal. Maybe together we can get somewhere, Any place is better. Starting from zero, got nothing to lose, Maybe we'll make something, Me, myself, I got nothing to prove. You got a fast car, And I got a plan to get us out of here. Been working at the convenience store, Managed to save just a little bit of money. Won't have to drive too far, Just across the border and into the city, And you and I can both get jobs. Finally see what it means to be living, See, my old man's got a problem, He lived with the bottle, that's the way it is, Said his body's too old for working, His body's too young to look like his.","thinking","Tracy Chapman"

Wish I didn't care, You'd been gone for hours, Could be anywhere, Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, Thought you would've grown eventually, but you proved me wrong, You ain't nothing but a lost cause, And this ain't nothing like it once was, I know you think you're such an outlaw (yeah).

And only so many hours in a day, hey, But you know that when the truth is told, That you can get what you want or you can just get old. You're gonna kick off before you even get halfway through, ooh, When will you realize Vienna waits for you? Slow down, you're doing fine, You can't be everything you wanna be before your time, Although it's so romantic on the borderline tonight, tonight, Too bad, but it's the life you lead, You're so ahead of yourself, that you forgot what you need. Though you can see when you're wrong, You know you can't always see when you're right, You're right.","thinking","The Stranger"
"Unwritten","Natasha Bedingfield","I am unwritten Can't read my mind, I'm undefined, I'm just beginning, The pen's in my hand, Ending unplanned. Staring at the blank page before you. Open up the dirty window, Let the sun illuminate the words that you could not find. Reaching for something in the distance, So close you can almost taste it. Release your inhibitions, Feel the rain on your skin, No one else can feel it for you, Only you can let it in, No one else, no one else, Can speak the words on your lips, Drench yourself in words unspoken Live your life with arms wide open Today is where your book begins, The rest is still unwritten.","thinking","Unwritten"

Maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats. Right now, she's probably up singing some, White-trash version of Shania karaoke. Right now, she's probably saying, 'I'm drunk', And he's a thinking that he's gonna get lucky. Right now, he's probably dabbing on, Three dollars worth of that bathroom Polo, Oh, and he don't know, Oh, that I dug my key into the side, Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive, Carved my name into his leather seats. I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights, Slashed a hole in all four tires, Maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats.","angry","Some Hearts"
